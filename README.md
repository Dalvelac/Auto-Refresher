This guide explains how to set up and run the provided Python script, which automates refreshing websites.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you need the following:

    Python 3.6+ installed. You can download it from python.org.
    Google Chrome installed as the browser.
    Chromedriver that matches your Chrome version. You can download it from Chromedriver.
    pip (Python package installer) to install required packages.

## Required Python Packages

You need to install the following packages:

    Selenium: For browser automation.
    Colorama: To add colored text in the command line interface.

To install all the dependencies, run:

`pip install selenium colorama`

## Chromedriver Setup

Ensure chromedriver is either in your system's PATH or in the same directory as the script. You can add it to your PATH by running:

`export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/chromedriver`

Replace /path/to/chromedriver with the actual path to where you've placed chromedriver.

## Running the Script

    Save the Script: Copy the provided Python code into a file named auto_refresh.py.
    Open Terminal: Navigate to the directory where auto_refresh.py is saved.
    Run the Script: Type the following command and press Enter:

`python auto_refresh.py`

## How to Use the Script

Upon running the script, you will see an interactive menu:

    Add Proxy: Allows you to add proxies to use while browsing.
    Add User-Agent: Add custom user-agents for browsing to avoid detection.
    Run the Auto-Refresh Script:
        Enter URLs separated by spaces.
        Choose an interval between refreshes.
        Choose how many times to refresh (0 for unlimited).
        Choose whether to run in headless mode (runs the browser without a visible GUI).
        Set a wait time after loading each page.
        Optionally take a screenshot after each refresh.
    Exit: Quit the script.

Example Usage

To run the script in auto-refresh mode:

    You will be prompted to enter multiple URLs to refresh.
    You can choose a refresh interval to specify how often each URL is refreshed.
    Choose if you want the browser in headless mode.

Notes

    Headless Mode: Headless mode allows Chrome to run without opening the browser window, which is useful for running on servers.
    Logging and Screenshots: Logs are printed in the terminal, and screenshots are saved in the current working directory.

Troubleshooting

    Chromedriver Issues: If Chrome isn't launching, make sure chromedriver is correctly set up and matches your installed Chrome version.
    Permission Denied: Use sudo before the command to run with administrator privileges.
    ImportError: Make sure you have installed all dependencies using pip install selenium colorama.
